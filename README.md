#Â TODO:

+ extract templating to technodelight/simplate w/ javascript, add `depends`
+ move jira client into separate class, inject it into the wrapper which will have the specific methods
+ hide branch names from list views, show branch names incl. generated when verbosity enabled
+ add verbosity handling where it makes sense (ie. show assignee if `-v`, show assignee and description if `-vv` etc)
+ add `--all` option for `in-progress` command to show what others are doing
+ log time command (https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#d2e2855)
+ interactive work log input (offer commit messages differing from develop (`git log develop..head --format=%s --no-merges`))
+ your daily/weekly worklog
+ add transitions configuration (`[transitions]` where `command="Transition"` like `pick="Picked up by dev"`)
+ refactor `PickupIssueCommand` to accept transition command and transition name from above config
+ add "story: PROJ-321 (https://sub.jira.domain/browse/PROJ-321)" info for every issues if available
+ search result renderer sort by stories
+ add default verbosity as 3 for in progress issues to show worklogs/comments
+ limit displaying previous worklogs for the recent 10
+ fix fatal error unexpected value exception not found
+ tabulate issue list better
+ display comments too when verbosity is very verbose
+ add filter options to todo (--stories --bugs --tasks --filter "search term")
+ fix weekly dashboard
+ render weekly dashboard similar as in Jira
+ fix dashboard to order columns by dates increment, add day name
- shorten in-progress --all view
- implement `init` command, which guides the user throughout the initial/per project setup
- add proper error handling if no configuration found
- add progress bar to in progress issues (original estimate vs time spent)
- aliasable tickets configuration (`[issue-aliases]` config section, accepts alias=issueKey configs like 'standup=PROJ-123')
- handle multiple projects at once, change `project` arguments to receive multiple projects separated by comma

```
    [projects]
    project=PROJ1
    project=PROJ2
```

- add cli autocomplete to commands ie. `jira pick PROJ-<tab` (check if `/transitions` returns the initial state of an issue (ie. `Open`) and filter issues based on this initial state)
- refactor helpers to benefit from symfony built-in helper solutions, therefore it will be available through `getHelper`
- refactor commands to extract business logic into separate action classes
- refactor to use service container
? create a jql query builder for assembling various queries?
x create `hub` tool helper class?
x preconfigure PR message for `hub` with issue id + summary + commit messages differing from develop (`git log develop..head --format=%s --no-merges`)
