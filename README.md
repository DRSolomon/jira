#Â TODO:

- pick an issue from todo command
- log time command (https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#d2e2855)
- create `hub` tool helper
- preconfigure PR message for `hub` with issue id + summary + commit messages differing from develop (without merges ofc)
- pull-request command using hub, with interactive work log input (offer something based on the date when dev picked up the task?)
- create jql query builder?
